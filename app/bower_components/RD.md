Room Account

  It is web application which allows user/group to track their expense activities. The goal behind this application is to reduce problems in friends (usually room mates) just because of money problems. As all we have not much money during academics and it's very difficult to remember/manage expense of dinner, lunch etc with friends. Very soon we are coming with this web application which will help you to manage these all stuff at one place and easily accessible.
